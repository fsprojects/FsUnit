[![Build Status](https://github.com/fsprojects/FsUnit/workflows/Build%20and%20Test/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/fsprojects/FsUnit/actions?query=branch%3Amaster)

**FsUnit** is a set of libraries that makes unit-testing with F# more enjoyable. It adds a special syntax to your favorite .NET testing framework.
FsUnit currently supports NUnit, xUnit, and MsTest.

The goals of FsUnit are:

* to make unit-testing feel more at home in F#, i.e., more functional.
* to leverage existing test frameworks while at the same time adapting them to the F# language in new ways.

## Getting Involved

GitHub makes collaboration very easy. To get involved with FsUnit, simply follow the directions provided by GitHub to
fork this repository, then implement lots of cool stuff, and finally send a pull request.

A few things to keep in mind:

* Going forward, FsUnit will aim to support as much functionality as possible across all supported testing frameworks.

* Development environments need to be setup to run tests for xUnit and NUnit. A product like ReSharper can make this easier.

* Since the unit tests for FsUnit are written with FsUnit, failing tests are just as important as passing tests.
